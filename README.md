# This is just a website that I created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

### I am using it to get practice with using various Javascript libraries in order to improve my skills with web development.

### The setup of the website consists of several sections:

* An introduction of my background and my history
* My most recent programming experience
* My resume and previous experiences
* Some recent projects that I've been working on

#### This website is constantly under renovation as I add new projects or experiment with new technologies!
